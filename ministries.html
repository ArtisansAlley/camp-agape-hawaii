                        <p>We are a vibrant church with a congregation that looks to experience God in an intimate way.

                        <!-- Once a year, about 150 “Angels”—children of incarcerated parents—attend Camp Agape, sponsored by Camp Agape Hawaii. The camp first started in 2005 and stems from a mission to share God’s love with children whose parents are in prison. “Agape” love is always the theme at the camp, as volunteers and junior mentors strive to demonstrate the love of Christ to the camp attendees.  -->
                        <p>Camp Agape is an annual, four-day event filled with an intentional series of activities and events that facilitate sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ through love, trust, forgiveness, and hope. Camp Agape is the place where astonishing transformations happen that affect the whole family and can last generations.   The camp is just the beginning of a transformed life with Christ. With the new center, we will be able to provide more activities and events throughout the year that keep the children connected with their mentors, who love and encourage them.</p>

                        <p>Through Bible study, worship and prayer, inmates are given a chance to break free from mental, emotional, and spiritual bondage, and are encouraged and empowered to become productive members of society when they’re released from prison.</p>
